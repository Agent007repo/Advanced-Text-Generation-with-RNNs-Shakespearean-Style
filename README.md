# Advanced Text Generation with RNNs: Shakespearean Style

## üìù Overview

This project explores advanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for creative text generation, focusing on emulating the style of William Shakespeare. It implements and compares vanilla RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The project incorporates techniques such as bidirectional layers, embedding layers, various optimization strategies, temperature-controlled sampling, and beam search to generate coherent and stylistically relevant text.

The primary dataset used is Shakespeare's writings, with a detailed analysis of model performance using perplexity and qualitative assessments.

## üöÄ Project Tasks & Features

This project, detailed in the `Prof_Faith_Text_Generation_with_RNNs.ipynb` notebook, covers the following key areas:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Tokenization of the text corpus (e.g., words, or subwords using techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece).
    *   Experimentation with additional preprocessing steps like stemming or custom vocabulary reduction.
    *   Generation and handling of input sequences of varying lengths to test model robustness.

2.  **RNN Architecture Implementation & Comparison:**
    *   **Models:** Implementation of:
        *   Vanilla RNN
        *   LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
        *   GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
    *   **Enhancements:** Introduction of bidirectional layers to capture contextual information from both past and future tokens.
    *   **Input Representation:** Utilization of embedding layers to transform input text tokens into dense vector representations.

3.  **Model Training and Optimization:**
    *   **Optimizers:** Comparison of different optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) and their impact on training stability and convergence.
    *   **Stability:** Implementation of gradient clipping to prevent the exploding gradients problem.
    *   **Training Techniques:** Use of teacher forcing during the training phase and measurement of its effect on model convergence speed and performance.

4.  **Advanced Text Generation Strategies:**
    *   **Controlled Randomness:** Experimentation with temperature-controlled sampling to adjust the creativity versus coherence of the generated text.
    *   **Quality Enhancement:** Implementation of beam search to generate higher-quality and more probable sequences.
    *   **Stylistic Analysis:** Using generated text to analyze and compare stylistic differences between Shakespeare‚Äôs original style and the model's output.

5.  **Evaluation and Analysis:**
    *   **Quantitative Metric:** Evaluation of models using perplexity.
    *   **Qualitative Assessment:** Comparison of the quality, coherence, and diversity of text generated by different architectures and techniques.
    *   **Documentation:** Detailed reporting of challenges encountered (e.g., overfitting, convergence issues) and insights gained throughout the project.

## üìö Dataset

The primary dataset for this project consists of **Shakespeare's writings**. The assignment also suggests the potential for extending this dataset by combining it with other corpora (e.g., contemporary poetry or novels) to analyze stylistic blending, though this specific implementation focuses on the Shakespearean corpus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated based on:
*   **Perplexity:** A standard intrinsic evaluation metric for language models, measuring how well the probability distribution predicted by the model aligns with the actual distribution of the test data.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:** Subjective assessment of the generated text's coherence, grammatical correctness, creativity, and stylistic similarity to Shakespeare's works.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing the performance and output quality of the vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU models, as well as the impact of different generation techniques (e.g., temperature sampling, beam search).

## üí° Key Learnings & Insights (Expected)

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into:
*   The comparative strengths and weaknesses of different RNN architectures (vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU) for sequential data like text.
*   The impact of architectural choices (e.g., bidirectionality) and training techniques (e.g., teacher forcing, gradient clipping) on model performance.
*   The effectiveness of advanced sampling methods (temperature sampling, beam search) in controlling the quality and creativity of generated text.
*   The challenges inherent in natural language generation, such as maintaining long-range dependencies, avoiding repetition, and achieving stylistic consistency.
